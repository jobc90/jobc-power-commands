> **v2**: 8 specialized test modes for targeted, expert-level QA.

## User Request

$ARGUMENTS

## Phase 0: Guard Clause

If the request is NOT a QA/testing request:
- Respond directly as a normal conversation
- Do NOT execute any harness phases

Proceed when the user wants to:
- Test a deployed/running application
- Run QA scenarios against a live environment
- Verify features work end-to-end
- Find bugs in an existing application
- Generate a QA report with actionable fix items
- Audit onboarding, forms, responsiveness, accessibility, or user journeys
- Run pre-launch QA or visual regression checks

### Required Information

The user MUST provide (ask if missing):
1. **Target URL**: The application URL to test against
2. **Credentials**: Login accounts for each user type (or test account info)

Optional but helpful:
- Database connection info (for data verification)
- Specific areas to focus on
- Known issues to skip
- CSS/code changes made (for `--mode regression`)

## Arguments

- First argument: target URL or task description (required)
- `--mode <mode>`: test mode (default: `full`) — see Test Modes below
- `--focus <area>`: focus testing on specific module/feature
- `--user-types <types>`: limit to specific user types (comma-separated)
- `--quick`: CRITICAL scenarios only (skip HIGH/MEDIUM)
- `--viewports <sizes>`: custom viewport sizes for responsive mode (default: `375,768,1280,1920`)
- `--change <description>`: describe what changed (for regression mode)

## Test Modes

| Mode | Purpose | Scout Focus | Key Capability |
|------|---------|-------------|----------------|
| `full` | Comprehensive functional QA (default) | All routes, users, features | Full scenario matrix |
| `onboarding` | Onboarding flow audit | Signup/onboarding steps, first-use flows | Drop-off detection, state screenshots |
| `forms` | Form validation & edge cases | All forms, inputs, validation rules | Boundary values, XSS vectors, error UX |
| `responsive` | Cross-viewport layout testing | Key pages, layout components | Multi-viewport screenshots, overflow detection |
| `regression` | Visual regression after deployment | Changed pages/components | Before/after comparison, unintended side effects |
| `journey` | User journey documentation | Complete user flows from landing to value | Screenshot map, timing, confusion points |
| `a11y` | Accessibility spot check (WCAG) | Interactive elements, forms, color usage | Contrast, focus states, labels, tap targets |
| `pre-launch` | Pre-launch test plan generation | Full feature inventory | Test plan document (no execution) |

### Mode Combinations

Modes can be combined: `--mode forms,a11y` runs both form testing and accessibility checks.
`--mode full` includes all modes by default but with less depth per mode.

---

## Phase 1: Setup

```bash
mkdir -p .harness
```

Write the user's request, target URL, credentials, options, and **selected mode** to `.harness/qa-prompt.md`.

Include in the prompt file:
- Selected mode(s) and their implications
- For `regression` mode: the `--change` description
- For `responsive` mode: the viewport sizes to test
- For `pre-launch` mode: launch date if provided

**CRITICAL**: Never write raw credentials (passwords, tokens) to files. Reference them as "provided in task description" or use environment variable names.

---

## Phase 2: Scout

Read the scout prompt template: `~/.claude/harness/scout-prompt.md`

Launch a **general-purpose Agent** with subagent_type `Explore`:
- **prompt**: The scout prompt template + context:
  - "Project directory: `{cwd}`"
  - "User's request: `{$ARGUMENTS}`"
  - "Scale: L — comprehensive scan for QA purposes."
  - "**Test mode**: `{selected mode}`"
  - "Write output to `.harness/qa-context.md`"
  - Mode-specific focus instructions (see below)
- **description**: "harness-qa scout"

### Mode-Specific Scout Focus

| Mode | Scout Must Discover |
|------|-------------------|
| `full` | All routes, user types, API endpoints, DB schema, auth system, forms, CRUD ops, state transitions |
| `onboarding` | Signup flow steps, onboarding sequence, first-use gates, welcome screens, tutorial triggers, activation metrics |
| `forms` | ALL form elements (inputs, selects, textareas, checkboxes), validation rules in code, error message patterns, required fields, field constraints (maxLength, pattern) |
| `responsive` | Key pages list, CSS breakpoints in use, layout components (grid, flex, sidebar, nav), media queries, mobile-specific components |
| `regression` | Changed files (from `--change` or recent git diff), affected routes/components, CSS dependencies, shared style files |
| `journey` | Landing page, signup, onboarding, dashboard, core feature pages — full user flow from first visit to value moment |
| `a11y` | Interactive elements, form labels, color palette/theme, icon-only buttons, focus management patterns, aria attributes in code |
| `pre-launch` | Complete feature inventory, all modules, all user types, all integrations, env dependencies, known risk areas |

After Scout completes, briefly confirm: **"Scout 완료. [X]개 라우트, [Y]개 유저 타입, [Z]개 핵심 기능 감지. 모드: {mode}."**

---

## Phase 3: Scenarios

Read the scenario writer prompt template: `~/.claude/harness/scenario-writer-prompt.md`

Launch a **general-purpose Agent**:
- **prompt**: The scenario writer prompt template + context:
  - "Codebase context: `.harness/qa-context.md`"
  - "Target URL: `{URL}`"
  - "Test credentials: `{provided credentials — pass securely}`"
  - "**Test mode**: `{selected mode}`"
  - "Focus area: `{--focus value if provided, otherwise 'all features'}`"
  - "User types: `{--user-types value if provided, otherwise 'all types from context'}`"
  - "Quick mode: `{--quick if specified}`"
  - "Viewports: `{--viewports value if responsive mode}`"
  - "Change description: `{--change value if regression mode}`"
  - "Write output to `.harness/qa-scenarios.md`"
- **description**: "harness-qa scenario writer ({mode})"

### Special Mode Behavior — `pre-launch`

For `pre-launch` mode, the Scenario Writer produces a **Test Plan document** instead of executable scenarios:
- Core user flows with acceptance criteria
- Test cases per module
- Edge case and negative test inventory
- Device/browser test matrix
- Risk areas requiring extra attention
- Time estimate per test case
- **Output**: `.harness/qa-test-plan.md`
- **Pipeline stops here** — no Phase 4/5. Present the test plan to the user.

After completion:
- Read `.harness/qa-scenarios.md` (or `qa-test-plan.md` for pre-launch)
- Present summary to user:
  - Total scenarios count
  - Coverage matrix (feature × user type, or mode-specific matrix)
  - CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM breakdown
  - Any CREDENTIALS NEEDED flags
  - For `responsive`: viewport × page matrix
  - For `a11y`: WCAG criterion coverage
- Ask: **"테스트 시나리오를 검토해주세요. 진행할까요, 추가/수정할 시나리오가 있나요?"**
- **WAIT for user approval.**

---

## Phase 4: Execute-Analyze Loop

Read the test executor and analyst prompt templates from `~/.claude/harness/`.

**Skip this phase entirely for `pre-launch` mode** (pipeline ends at Phase 3).

### Max rounds: 2

Round 2 is only triggered if the user requests re-testing after fixes are applied.

#### 4a. Execute

Launch a **general-purpose Agent**:
- **prompt**: The test executor prompt template + context:
  - "Test scenarios: `.harness/qa-scenarios.md`"
  - "Target URL: `{URL}`"
  - "Test credentials: `{provided credentials}`"
  - "**Test mode**: `{selected mode}`"
  - "Write output to `.harness/qa-results.md`"
  - If round 2: "This is a re-test after fixes. Focus on previously FAIL/PARTIAL scenarios. Reference `.harness/qa-analysis.md` for what was fixed."
  - "You MUST use Playwright MCP tools (mcp__playwright__*) to test the live app."
  - Mode-specific executor instructions (see below)
- **description**: "harness-qa test executor round {R} ({mode})"

### Mode-Specific Executor Instructions

| Mode | Special Executor Behavior |
|------|--------------------------|
| `full` | Standard execution — all scenarios by priority |
| `onboarding` | Screenshot EVERY step/state. Time each transition. Note loading states, empty states, error states. Flag drop-off points where a user would abandon. |
| `forms` | Use the **Form Test Pattern Library** (see executor prompt). Test empty submit, 500+ char strings, special chars (`@#$%'"<>`), invalid formats, SQL/XSS vectors. Screenshot every error and success state. |
| `responsive` | Use `mcp__playwright__browser_resize` at each viewport (375, 768, 1280, 1920 or custom). Screenshot each page at each viewport. Check: text clipping, overflow, button overlap, nav collapse, CTA visibility. |
| `regression` | Screenshot the 5+ most important pages. Compare against expected layout. Flag shifted elements, color changes, broken hover states, spacing differences. Verify the intended change applied. |
| `journey` | Screenshot every screen from landing to core value moment. Time each step. Note confusion points, unnecessary friction, missing feedback. Build a visual journey map. |
| `a11y` | Check: low-contrast text, small tap targets (<44px), missing form labels, color-only status indicators, missing focus states, missing aria attributes. Use `browser_snapshot` for accessibility tree inspection. |

After completion:
- Read `.harness/qa-results.md`
- Briefly report: **"테스트 실행 완료. [X]개 시나리오 중 PASS: [N], FAIL: [N], PARTIAL: [N], BLOCKED: [N]."**

#### 4b. Analyze

Launch a **general-purpose Agent**:
- **prompt**: The analyst prompt template + context:
  - "Test results: `.harness/qa-results.md`"
  - "Test scenarios: `.harness/qa-scenarios.md`"
  - "Codebase context: `.harness/qa-context.md`"
  - "**Test mode**: `{selected mode}`"
  - "Write output to `.harness/qa-analysis.md`"
- **description**: "harness-qa analyst ({mode})"

#### 4c. Evaluate

After Analyst completes:
1. Read `.harness/qa-analysis.md`
2. Report to user:
   - Overall pass rate
   - CRITICAL bug count
   - Pattern count
   - Missing feature count
   - Mode-specific metrics (see below)
3. **Decision**:
   - If user wants to fix and re-test → proceed to round 2 (user fixes bugs, then re-runs Phase 4)
   - Otherwise → proceed to Phase 5

### Mode-Specific Evaluation Metrics

| Mode | Additional Metrics |
|------|-------------------|
| `onboarding` | Steps to activation, estimated drop-off rate, blocking UX issues |
| `forms` | Vulnerable fields count, silent failure count, invalid-accept count |
| `responsive` | Viewport breakage matrix (which pages break at which sizes) |
| `regression` | Intended changes verified, unintended regressions found |
| `journey` | Total journey time, friction point count, screenshot count |
| `a11y` | WCAG violations by severity, affected component count |

---

## Phase 5: Report

Read the qa-reporter prompt template: `~/.claude/harness/qa-reporter-prompt.md`

Launch a **general-purpose Agent**:
- **prompt**: The qa-reporter prompt template + context:
  - "Analysis: `.harness/qa-analysis.md`"
  - "Test results: `.harness/qa-results.md`"
  - "Test scenarios: `.harness/qa-scenarios.md`"
  - "Codebase context: `.harness/qa-context.md`"
  - "**Test mode**: `{selected mode}`"
  - "Write output to `.harness/qa-report.md`"
- **description**: "harness-qa reporter ({mode})"

After completion:
- Read `.harness/qa-report.md`
- Present user-facing summary:

```
## QA Complete ({mode} mode)

**Grade**: [A/B/C/D/F] ([score]%)
**Verdict**: [READY / READY_WITH_ISSUES / NOT_READY]
**Scenarios**: [X] tested | PASS: [N] | FAIL: [N] | BLOCKED: [N]
**Bugs**: CRITICAL: [N] | HIGH: [N] | MEDIUM: [N]

**Top Issues**:
1. [one-line]
2. [one-line]
3. [one-line]

Full report: `.harness/qa-report.md`
```

- Ask: **"QA 리포트를 확인해주세요. 수정 후 재테스트가 필요하면 `/harness-qa` 를 다시 실행해주세요."**

---

## Critical Rules

1. **Each agent = separate Agent tool call** with fresh context.
2. **ALL inter-agent communication through `.harness/qa-` files only.**
3. **Test Executor MUST use Playwright MCP** (`mcp__playwright__*`) for all UI testing. Code reading alone is NOT testing.
4. **NEVER store raw credentials in `.harness/qa-` files.** Reference them by variable name or "provided in task description."
5. **ALWAYS present scenarios to the user and wait for approval** before executing tests.
6. **The Test Executor does NOT fix bugs.** It tests and reports.
7. **The Analyst does NOT re-test.** It analyzes results from the Executor.
8. **Read prompt templates from `~/.claude/harness/`** before spawning each agent.
9. **Quick mode (`--quick`)**: Scenario Writer generates only CRITICAL scenarios. Test Executor skips HIGH/MEDIUM.
10. **Mode is passed to EVERY agent.** Each agent adapts its behavior based on the selected mode.
11. **`pre-launch` mode stops at Phase 3.** It produces a test plan, not test results.
12. **`responsive` mode requires `browser_resize`** at every viewport before screenshots.
13. **`regression` mode requires `--change` description** to know what to verify.

## Cost Awareness

| Mode | Duration | Agent Calls |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--quick` | 10-20 min | 5 (scout + scenario + executor + analyst + reporter) |
| `full` (default) | 20-45 min | 5 (scout + scenario + executor + analyst + reporter) |
| `onboarding` | 15-30 min | 5 |
| `forms` | 20-40 min | 5 |
| `responsive` | 15-30 min | 5 (screenshots × viewports) |
| `regression` | 10-25 min | 5 |
| `journey` | 15-30 min | 5 |
| `a11y` | 15-25 min | 5 |
| `pre-launch` | 5-15 min | 2 (scout + scenario writer only) |
| re-test (round 2) | +15-30 min | +2 (executor + analyst) |
