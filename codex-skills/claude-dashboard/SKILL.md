# Claude Dashboard

## Overview

Run the Codex version of `/claude-dashboard`. Treat `/claude-dashboard` and `$claude-dashboard` as the same workflow intent inside Codex.

This is a setup tool, not a multi-agent harness.

## Workflow

1. Read `~/.claude/settings.json`.
2. Update the `statusLine` field to:

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/dashboard/statusline.js"
  }
}
```

3. Replace `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` with the actual absolute path to this repository root.
4. If `claude-hud` is present in `enabledPlugins`, remove it.
5. Show the updated settings and confirm the change.
6. Tell the user to restart Claude Code or run `/mcp` to see the new statusline.

## Rules

- Patch the existing settings file instead of replacing unrelated user settings.
- If `~/.claude/settings.json` does not exist, create the minimal valid JSON structure needed for this change.
- Do not touch Codex settings. This skill configures Claude Code's statusline only.
